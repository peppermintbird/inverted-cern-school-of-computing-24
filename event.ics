DESCRIPTION:Speakers: Andrzej Nowicki (CERN)\, Kristina Gunne (CERN)\, Alb
 erto Pace (CERN)\n\nThe Inverted CSC (iCSC) is a 4 day long school\, orga
 nised at CERN. It consists of lectures and hands-on exercises on a variety
  of topics\, given by former CSC students. This school provides the studen
 ts with a platform to share their knowledge – and by doing so\, it effec
 tively “inverts” the roles by turning students into teachers.\nWe are 
 mainly inviting the most recent students to apply\, but welcome abstracts 
 from any former CSC student as well. The topics for the iCSC 2024 will inc
 lude HEP computing and simulations\, Natural Language Processing\, Compute
 r Networks and many others. More information on the full programme will fo
 llow shortly. \nThe school will take place on April 15-18\, 2024 as a hyb
 rid event - at CERN and on Zoom.  \nRegistration is open!By registering y
 ou are not obliged to stay for all lectures\, you can attend the ones that
  interest you the most.\n\n\nhttps://indico.cern.ch/event/1334738/\n\nInve
